# Process Goals

## Concept

**Outcome goals** focus on WHAT you want to achieve:
- "Close the deal"
- "Hit $1M ARR"
- "Launch the product"

**Process goals** focus on HOW you do it:
- "Reach out to 100 potential clients"
- "Send 5 proposals per week"
- "Conduct 3 customer interviews this week"

## Why Process Goals Work Better

Based on research (meta-analysis of 27 experiments in sports):

1. **Control** — You control actions, not outcomes. "Close deal" creates anxiety; "send 3 follow-ups" is actionable.
2. **Confidence** — Process goals turn challenge into achievable steps, boosting self-efficacy.
3. **Focus** — Daily clarity on what to do, not vague aspiration.

## How to Transform

| Outcome Goal | Process Goal |
|--------------|--------------|
| "Close the deal with X" | "Send 1 follow-up per day to client X" |
| "Launch product" | "2h deep work on MVP every morning" |
| "Get 10 clients" | "Write 5 outreach messages per day" |
| "Prepare the program" | "30 min research analogs daily" |
| "Find a partner" | "1 networking message per day" |

## Patterns for Process Goals

### Time Blocks
Regular dedicated time for deep work:
- "2h deep work on [project] every morning 6-8am"
- "1h research [topic] after lunch"

### Frequency Commitments
Consistent action cadence:
- "1 outreach message per day"
- "3 customer calls per week"
- "5 proposals per week"

### Checkpoints
Review milestones:
- "Show draft to 1 person before Friday"
- "Review progress with mentor on Wednesday"

### Streaks
Daily habits:
- "30 min movement every day"
- "10 min journaling in the morning"

## When Processing Voice Entries

If user says outcome goal, consider transforming:

```
User: "Need to close the deal with client X"

BAD: Create task "Close deal with client X" p1
→ Vague, creates anxiety, unclear next action

GOOD: Create task "Send follow-up to client X with updated proposal" p1 due:tomorrow
→ Specific, actionable, controllable
```

## For Weekly Planning

When generating Process Commitments for ONE Big Thing:

1. **Ask:** What daily/weekly habits would make this inevitable?
2. **Limit:** 3-5 process commitments max
3. **Prioritize:** Time blocks > Frequency > Checkpoints
4. **Create:** Recurring tasks in TickTick with appropriate patterns

## Recurring Task Patterns

Map process goals to TickTick recurring patterns:

| Process | dueString |
|---------|-----------|
| "every morning" | "every day at 6am" |
| "every day" | "every day" |
| "every workday" | "every weekday" |
| "3 times per week" | "every monday, wednesday, friday" |
| "once a week" | "every week" |
| "by Friday" | "friday" (one-time) |

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid creating process goals that are:
- Too vague: "Work on project" (how much? when?)
- Too ambitious: "4h deep work 5 days a week" (unsustainable)
- Untrackable: "Think about strategy" (not measurable)

Good process goals are:
- Specific in action
- Bounded in time/frequency
- Trackable (done/not done)

## Reference

Based on: Meta-analysis of 27 experiments in sports showing process goals significantly outperform outcome/performance goals.
